ksmtp
=====

Simple Python SMTP relay replacement for sendmail with SSL authentication

Useful for relaying all email through an account like Gmail, without the
messy configurations of Postfix / Sendmail.

Similar to the 'ssmtp' project, but written in Python

Usage:
  1) pip install ksmtp
  2) edit /etc/ksmtp.conf with your login credentials
  3) (optional) create symlink to ksmtp to replace sendmail
     ln -s `which ksmtp` /usr/sbin/sendmail
  4) send test mail
     ksmtp test@test.com -s "some subject"
